        <h1 class="glowheading">About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am an electrical engineer who loves very much computers world and especially programming, this love
            becomes greater and greater until I decide to work in this domain as a professional programmer from 2 years.
        </p>

        <p>I worked as physics, mathematics & computer high school teacher for 25 years ago, until a big crisis in the
            field
            of teaching in Lebanon occurred from 3 years ago, so I decide to leave the domain of teaching and work as a
            professional programmer and this has been my wish since I was a teenager.</p>

        <p> I started learning programming from 2 years depending on 2 characteristics I have them as a high school
            teacher which are the patience and the love of reading and learning every day.</p>

        <p>And after 2 years of daily learning with great passion I become an expert programmer in many computer
            languages like Python, Dart (Flutter), JavaScript, HTML, CSSâ€¦ </p>

        <p>Also I love very much graphic design and its related programs and this love is based on my hoppy of painting
            and photographing since I was a child, based on all of that I become an expert graphic designer in Adobe
            Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.</p>

        <p>Now I am eagerly looking forward to work in the field of programming as a professional and creative
            programmer who has a sense of art as a graphic designer, and I have a great motivation to learn, develop and
            accumulate experiences every day.</p>

        <p>My motto will always be patience, humility, and learning is the path to success in life.</p>

        <h2>You all my Love</h2>
